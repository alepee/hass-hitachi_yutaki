# v2.0.0-beta.7 Release Notes

**Release Date**: 2026-01-23  
**Status**: Ready for Testing

---

## 🎯 Overview

Beta.7 introduces **automatic entity migration** to solve the "legacy entities still present" issue reported by users upgrading from v1.9.x. This release ensures a seamless upgrade experience with no manual intervention required.

---

## ✨ What's New

### 🔄 Automatic Entity Migration System

**Issue Resolved**: [#8](https://github.com/alepee/hass-hitachi_yutaki/issues/8) - Legacy entities appearing as "unavailable" after upgrade

When upgrading from v1.9.x to v2.0.0, the integration now automatically migrates entity unique IDs to the new format. This eliminates duplicate entities and preserves your entity history.

**Key Features**:
- ✅ **100% Automatic**: No user action required
- ✅ **History Preserved**: Entity IDs remain unchanged
- ✅ **Clean Migration**: Old unavailable entities disappear
- ✅ **Safe**: Conflict detection and error handling
- ✅ **Comprehensive**: Handles all entity types and prefixes

**Migration Types Supported**:

1. **Simple Migrations** (~35 entities)
   - Removes Modbus slave ID from unique_id
   - Example: `{entry_id}_1_outdoor_temp` → `{entry_id}_outdoor_temp`

2. **Complex Migrations** (~6 entities)
   - Removes slave ID AND renames key
   - Examples:
     - `{entry_id}_1_alarm_code` → `{entry_id}_alarm`
     - `{entry_id}_1_thermal_power` → `{entry_id}_thermal_power_heating`
     - `{entry_id}_1_otc_method_heating` → `{entry_id}_otc_calculation_method_heating`

3. **Prefix Support**
   - Circuit entities: `circuit1_`, `circuit2_`
   - DHW entities: `dhw_`
   - Pool entities: `pool_`

**How It Works**:
1. Migration runs automatically during integration setup
2. Scans entity registry for old format entities
3. Calculates new unique_id (with key migrations if needed)
4. Updates entity registry
5. Logs all actions for troubleshooting

**User Experience**:
- Upgrade from 1.9.x to beta.7
- Restart Home Assistant
- Migration runs automatically
- Old unavailable entities disappear
- Entity history is preserved
- Only active entities remain

### 🔧 Functional Repair Flow for Migration

**Issue Resolved**: [#19](https://github.com/alepee/hass-hitachi_yutaki/issues/19) - Repair flow button not working

When upgrading from v1.9.3, users needed to provide `gateway_type` and `profile` parameters. A repair issue was created, but clicking the "Fix" button did nothing.

**Root Cause**:
- Missing `async_create_fix_flow()` handler function
- Incorrect architecture (repair logic in `config_flow.py` instead of dedicated `repairs.py`)
- Wrong import path for `RepairFlow`

**Fix Implemented**:
- ✅ Created dedicated `repairs.py` platform following Home Assistant conventions
- ✅ Implemented `MissingConfigRepairFlow` class inheriting from `RepairsFlow`
- ✅ Added `async_create_fix_flow()` factory function as entry point
- ✅ Automatic integration reload after repair completion
- ✅ Removed repair redirect from OptionsFlow
- ✅ Fixed import: `homeassistant.components.repairs.RepairsFlow`

**User Experience**:
1. Upgrade from 1.9.3 to beta.7
2. Integration setup fails (missing parameters)
3. Repair issue appears in **Settings → System → Repairs**
4. Click **"Fix"** → Form opens ✅
5. Select gateway type and profile
6. Click **"Submit"** → Integration reloads automatically
7. Integration is immediately functional

## 🧪 Testing

### Comprehensive Unit Tests

Added complete test coverage for entity migration:
- ✅ Simple migrations (slave_id removal)
- ✅ Complex migrations (slave_id + key rename)
- ✅ Circuit prefix handling
- ✅ DHW prefix handling
- ✅ Pool prefix handling
- ✅ OTC method key renames
- ✅ Different slave IDs (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- ✅ No migration needed cases
- ✅ Invalid format handling

Run tests: `pytest tests/test_entity_migration.py`

    "daily_thermal_energy": "thermal_energy_heating_daily",
    "total_thermal_energy": "thermal_energy_heating_total",

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### For Users Upgrading from 1.9.x

1. **Backup Recommended**: Although migration is safe, consider backing up your Home Assistant configuration
2. **Check Logs**: After restart, check logs for migration summary
3. **Verify Entities**: Confirm old unavailable entities are gone
4. **Report Issues**: If migration fails for any entity, please report with logs

### For Users Already on Beta.3-6

- Migration will detect that entities are already in new format
- No changes will be made
- Safe to upgrade

### Logging

Check migration results in Home Assistant logs:
```bash
grep "Entity migration" home-assistant.log
```

Expected log messages:
- `INFO: Migrated entity sensor.xxx: old_id -> new_id`
- `INFO: Entity migration completed: X entities migrated, Y failed`
