# Release Notes - Beta.8

**Release Date**: 2026-02-03
**Version**: 2.0.0-beta.8
**Status**: ✅ Released

---

## Overview

Beta.8 focuses on improving integration robustness and configuration reliability by implementing hardware-based unique identifiers for config entries using Modbus Input Registers.

---

## What's New

### Hardware-based Config Entry Identification

**Issue**: [#162](https://github.com/alepee/hass-hitachi_yutaki/issues/162)

Config entries now use the gateway's hardware identifier (read from Modbus Input Registers) as their unique identifier instead of the IP+slave combination.

#### Benefits

✅ **Prevents Duplicate Entries**: You can no longer accidentally create multiple config entries for the same physical gateway
✅ **Survives IP Changes**: If your gateway's IP changes (DHCP), Home Assistant recognizes it as the same device
✅ **Works Everywhere**: Unlike MAC/ARP approach, this works in Docker containers, VMs, and all HA installation types
✅ **Best Practice Compliance**: Follows Home Assistant's recommended approach for stable device identification
✅ **Automatic Migration**: Existing installations automatically get the new unique_id on next restart

#### How It Works

When you add a new gateway:
1. The integration connects to the gateway via Modbus (as before)
2. **NEW**: Reads Input Registers 0-2 (function code 04) containing hardware identifiers
3. Builds unique_id in format `hitachi_yutaki_XXXX-YYY-ZZ` (e.g., `hitachi_yutaki_3846-103-56`)
4. If Modbus read fails, falls back to IP+slave (graceful degradation)

**For existing installations**: On the next Home Assistant restart, the integration will automatically add the hardware-based unique_id to your existing config entry. No action required!

#### Technical Details

- Uses Modbus Input Registers 0-2 (function code 04)
- Register values are hardware/firmware identifiers, stable across reboots
- Method implemented in `ModbusApiClient.async_get_unique_id()`
- Completely transparent to users
- No impact on entities, history, or automations

#### Why Not MAC Address?

The initial approach using MAC addresses via ARP table lookup was abandoned because:
- ❌ **Docker isolation**: ARP table inside containers only shows internal Docker network (172.30.32.x)
- ❌ **Platform-dependent**: Required different commands for Linux/macOS/Windows
- ❌ **Cache issues**: ARP entries expire and require ping to refresh

The Modbus-based approach solves all these issues by using the existing Modbus connection.

---

## Migration Notes

### From Beta.7 to Beta.8

**No action required** - Migration is automatic.

On first restart with Beta.8:
- The integration will check if your config entry has a unique_id
- If missing, it will read the gateway's hardware identifier via Modbus
- The unique_id will be added automatically
- All entities, history, and automations remain unchanged

**What you'll see in logs**:
```
[hitachi_yutaki] Config entry has no unique_id, attempting to add one based on hardware identifier
[hitachi_yutaki] Added hardware-based unique_id to existing config entry: hitachi_yutaki_3846-103-56
```

Or, if Modbus read fails:
```
[hitachi_yutaki] Could not retrieve hardware identifier, using IP-based unique_id: 192.168.1.100_1
```

Both scenarios are normal and the integration will work correctly.

## Breaking Changes

**None** - This release is fully backward compatible.

### Enhanced Heat Pump Profile System

**Issues**: [#176](https://github.com/alepee/hass-hitachi_yutaki/issues/176), [#81](https://github.com/alepee/hass-hitachi_yutaki/issues/81), [#77](https://github.com/alepee/hass-hitachi_yutaki/issues/77)

Profiles now define explicit hardware capabilities for each heat pump model, improving auto-detection accuracy and enabling model-specific features.

#### New Profile Properties

| Property | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `dhw_min_temp` | Minimum DHW temperature (°C) | 30 |
| `dhw_max_temp` | Maximum DHW temperature by HP (°C) | 55 (S Combi), 75 (S80) |
| `max_circuits` | Maximum heating/cooling circuits | 2 (S), 1 (S Combi), 0 (Yutampo) |
| `supports_cooling` | Cooling capability | True (S, M), False (S80, Yutampo) |
| `max_water_outlet_temp` | Maximum water outlet (°C) | 60 (standard), 80 (S80) |
| `supports_high_temperature` | High-temp model flag | True (S80 only) |

#### Yutampo R32 Detection Fixed

Yutampo R32 is now correctly detected as a special case of S Combi (unit_model=1) with DHW-only configuration:
- ✅ `unit_model == "yutaki_s_combi"` AND
- ✅ `has_dhw == True` AND
- ✅ No circuits configured (heating/cooling)

#### S Combi Detection Improved

S Combi detection now checks ALL circuits (not just circuit 1):
- Previously: Only checked `has_circuit1_heating` or `has_circuit1_cooling`
- Now: Checks circuit1 AND circuit2 (heating and cooling)

This handles edge cases where only circuit 2 might be configured.

#### Profile Capabilities Summary

| Model | DHW | Max Circuits | Cooling | Max Water Temp | Pool | Boiler |
|-------|-----|--------------|---------|----------------|------|--------|
| Yutaki S | 30-55°C | 2 | ✅ (kit) | 60°C | ✅ | ✅ |
| Yutaki S Combi | 30-55°C | 1 | ✅ (kit) | 60°C | ✅ | ✅ |
| Yutaki S80 | 30-75°C | 2 | ❌ | 80°C | ✅ | ❌ |
| Yutaki M | 30-55°C | 2 | ✅ (native) | 60°C | ✅ | ✅ |
| Yutampo R32 | 30-55°C | 0 | ❌ | - | ❌ | ❌ |

## Bug Fixes

### Cooling Capability Detection

**Issue**: [#177](https://github.com/alepee/hass-hitachi_yutaki/issues/177)

Fixed a regression from v1.9.x where cooling features were not detected on units with optional cooling hardware (e.g., Yutaki S Combi with cooling option).

#### Root Cause

During the v2.0.0 refactoring, the `system_config` bitmask order was incorrectly swapped:

| Bit | Should Be | Was (Wrong) |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Circuit 2 Heating | Circuit 1 Cooling |
| 2 | Circuit 1 Cooling | Circuit 2 Heating |

This caused the integration to detect "Circuit 2 Heating" instead of "Circuit 1 Cooling" for users with cooling hardware.

#### Symptoms (Now Fixed)

- ❌ `operation_mode` select only showed "Auto" and "Heat" (no "Cool")
- ❌ Cooling thermal power/energy sensors not created
- ❌ Climate entities missing cooling HVAC mode

#### After Fix

- ✅ "Cool" option available in `operation_mode` select
- ✅ `thermal_power_cooling` sensor created
- ✅ `thermal_energy_cooling_daily` / `thermal_energy_cooling_total` sensors created
- ✅ Climate entities show proper HVAC modes
