## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Improved error handling in the data update coordinator to consistently create a repair issue in Home Assistant for any Modbus or network communication error.

### Fixed
- Resolved an issue where a loss of IP connectivity to the Modbus gateway could cause the integration to crash or behave unexpectedly. The integration now correctly handles network errors (`OSError`), ensuring that all entities become `unavailable` and properly recover once the connection is restored. ([#76](https://github.com/alepee/hass-hitachi_yutaki/issues/76))

## [1.9.0] - 2025-07-07

### Added
- New sensor to monitor the gateway's synchronization state (`Synchronized`, `Desynchronized`, `Initializing`).
- Pre-flight check during setup and updates to verify gateway synchronization status. This creates a persistent notification ("Repair") if the gateway is desynchronized, guiding the user to resolve the issue.

### Changed
- Improved startup resilience. The integration now caches the heat pump's configuration during the first successful setup. This ensures that all devices and entities are registered during subsequent Home Assistant startups, even if the heat pump is temporarily offline.

### Fixed
- Resolved a critical issue where all integration entities would disappear if the heat pump was offline when Home Assistant started. Entities will now appear as `unavailable` until the connection is restored.

## [1.8.2] - 2025-06-26

### Fixed
- Corrected the HACS installation link in `README.md` to ensure it redirects correctly.

### Changed
- Updated development dependencies, including `ruff` to v0.12.0.

## [1.8.1] - 2025-05-12

### Added
- New "Anti-legionella Cycle" button entity to manually start a high temperature anti-legionella treatment cycle.
- New binary sensor entity (`antilegionella_cycle`) indicating if an anti-legionella cycle is currently running.

### Changed
- Removed unused or redundant Domestic Hot Water (DHW) entities: DHW current temperature sensor, DHW target temperature number, DHW power switch, high demand switch, and periodic anti-legionella switch.
- Improved English and French translations for new entities and advanced configuration (water inlet/outlet temperature entities).

## [1.8.0] - 2025-05-11

### Changed
- The integration now allows configuration with central control modes Air (1), Water (2), or Total (3). Only Local (0) is forbidden.

- The documentation now recommends using Air (1) mode for most installations.
- Support for Hitachi Yutampo R32 machines (requires 'Total' (3) mode).
