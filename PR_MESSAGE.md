# 🚀 Release 2.0.0: Complete Architectural Overhaul

## 📋 Overview

This major release represents a complete architectural transformation of the Hitachi Yutaki integration, implementing **hexagonal architecture** (Ports and Adapters) and **domain-driven design** principles. This refactoring significantly improves maintainability, testability, and extensibility while adding robust connection recovery mechanisms.

## 🎯 Key Features

### 🔧 Robust Connection Recovery
- **Automatic Modbus reconnection** with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s intervals)
- **Transparent recovery** - entities reconnect without Home Assistant restart
- **Comprehensive logging** for debugging connection issues
- **Fixes issue #118** - integration now recovers from temporary network interruptions

### 🏗️ Hexagonal Architecture Implementation
- **Domain Layer**: Pure business logic with zero Home Assistant dependencies
- **Adapters Layer**: Concrete implementations bridging domain with Home Assistant
- **Entity Layer**: Domain-driven organization replacing technical grouping
- **100% testable** domain layer without Home Assistant mocks

### 🎨 Domain-Driven Entity Organization
- **Business domain structure**: `circuit/`, `compressor/`, `control_unit/`, `dhw/`, `gateway/`, `hydraulic/`, `performance/`, `pool/`, `power/`, `thermal/`
- **Builder pattern**: Type-safe entity creation with conditional logic
- **Platform orchestrators**: Simplified platform files acting as pure orchestrators
- **Enhanced modularity**: Each domain is self-contained

### 🔌 Comprehensive Business API
- **HitachiApiClient**: Typed methods for all controllable parameters
- **Eliminates direct Modbus access** from entities
- **Natural data types**: `float` for temperatures, `bool` for settings
- **Encapsulated logic**: Internal handling of register conversions

## 📊 Impact Summary

### Files Changed
- **109 files changed**: 8,437 insertions(+), 4,076 deletions(-)
- **Net addition**: +4,361 lines (significant architectural improvements)

### Major Structural Changes
- ✅ **New**: `domain/` - Pure business logic layer
- ✅ **New**: `adapters/` - Infrastructure implementations
- ✅ **New**: `entities/` - Domain-driven entity organization
- ✅ **New**: `api/` - Business-level API abstraction
- ✅ **Refactored**: All platform files as orchestrators
- ✅ **Removed**: Legacy `services/` directory

## 🔄 Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
- **Architecture**: Complete migration to hexagonal architecture
- **Entity Creation**: Now uses builder pattern instead of direct instantiation
- **API Access**: Entities must use `HitachiApiClient` instead of direct Modbus
- **Import Structure**: Platform files import from `entities/` domains

### Backward Compatibility
- ✅ **User Experience**: No changes to entity names or functionality
- ✅ **Configuration**: Existing configurations remain compatible
- ✅ **Features**: All existing features preserved and enhanced

## 🧪 Testing & Quality

### Enhanced Testability
- **Domain Layer**: 100% testable without Home Assistant mocks
- **Service Layer**: Business logic centralized for easier unit testing
- **Dependency Injection**: Enables comprehensive component testing

### Code Quality Improvements
- **Reduced Complexity**: Broke down monolithic files (sensor.py: 1657 → ~150 lines)
- **Eliminated Duplication**: Centralized entity creation logic
- **Improved Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns

## 📚 Documentation

### New Documentation
- **[Domain Layer](custom_components/hitachi_yutaki/domain/README.md)**: Pure business logic documentation
- **[Adapters Layer](custom_components/hitachi_yutaki/adapters/README.md)**: Infrastructure implementations
- **[Entities Layer](custom_components/hitachi_yutaki/entities/README.md)**: Domain-driven organization
- **Updated README.md**: Reflects new architecture and structure

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Data Conversion Improvements
- **Centralized deserialization** logic in register definitions
- **Pattern-based naming**: `convert_from_tenths()`, `convert_signed_16bit()`, `convert_pressure()`
- **Fixed conversions**: Secondary compressor current, pressure sensors

### Modbus Register Organization
- **Logical device grouping**: `gateway`, `control_unit`, `primary_compressor`, `secondary_compressor`, `circuit_1`, `circuit_2`, `dhw`, `pool`
- **Constants migration**: Moved from shared `const.py` to Modbus gateway layer

### Entity Identifier Updates
- **`r134a_` → `secondary_compressor_`**: Better readability
- **Alarm sensor enhancement**: Description as state, numeric code as attribute

## 🚀 Future Benefits

### Extensibility
- **New Gateways**: Architecture prepared for HTTP-based gateways
- **Storage Solutions**: Abstract storage interface ready for persistent storage
- **Profile Detection**: Decentralized detection logic for complex model identification

### Maintainability
- **Single Point of Truth**: Business logic centralized in domain layer
- **Clear Boundaries**: Separation between business logic and infrastructure
- **Modular Design**: Easy to add new entity types or modify existing ones
